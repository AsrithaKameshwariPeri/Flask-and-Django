# Flask-and-Django
Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework for Python web development1. It's ideal for small to medium-sized projects and allows developers to have more control over their application's structure whereas Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development. It's suitable for larger, more complex projects and comes with many built-in features.
